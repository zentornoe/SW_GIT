<PRINT DIGITS AS PRAMID>
all digits are 1~9.
HW 14.java : scan the integer and print pramid shaped numbers, each line' number is starting from 1 and increasing from right to left
HW 15.java : simmilar to HW14, but each line is symmetric digit patterns
HW 16.java : simmilar to HW14, HW15. the digits should be connected even when the lines change. odd line is left to right, even line is right to left.


HW2_2.java : Determines whether the received 9 by 9 matrix is Sudoku. If it is sudoku - valid / is not - invalid. First variable s is 45(sum of 1 to 9). and compare with each column, row, square's sum. If it is same, it is sudoku.
HW2_3.java : Input the size of the matrix and print the sum of each column and row at the bottom and left.
HW2_4.java : Randomly generate scores from 0 to 100, and output a histogram that goes up from the bottom, breaking into 10 units, such as 0≤x <10, 10≤x <20, ... , 90≤x≤100 .

<MATLAB>
interp.m : select method 'lagrange' of 'newton'. this function performs interpolation of polynomial.
falespos.m : fin the root by using false position method, maximum iteration : 50(default)
goldmax.m : find the root by using goldmax method
modsecant.m : find the root by using modified secant method.
