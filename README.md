## PRINT DIGITS AS PRAMID
* all digits are 1~9.

----
### HW 14.java
* scan the integer and print pramid shaped numbers, each line' number is starting from 1 and increasing from right to left
---
### HW 15.java
* simmilar to HW14, but each line is symmetric digit patterns
---
### HW 16.java 
* simmilar to HW14, HW15. the digits should be connected even when the lines change. 
* odd line is left to right, even line is right to left.

## HW2_2.java 
* Determines whether the received 9 by 9 matrix is Sudoku. If it is sudoku - valid / is not - invalid.
* First variable s is 45(sum of 1 to 9). and compare with each column, row, square's sum. If it is same, it is sudoku.
---
## HW2_3.java
* Input the size of the matrix and print the sum of each column and row at the bottom and left.

---
## HW2_4.java
* Randomly generate scores from 0 to 100, and output a histogram that goes up from the bottom, breaking into 10 units, such as 0≤x <10, 10≤x <20, ... , 90≤x≤100 .

---
## falespos.m 
* fin the root by using false position method, maximum iteration : 50(default)

---
## goldmax.m 
* find the root by using goldmax method

---
## modsecant.m
