### PRINT DIGITS AS PRAMID
all digits are 1~9.

#### 1) JAVA_1_1.java
scan the integer and print pramid shaped numbers, each line' number is starting from 1 and increasing from right to left

#### 2) JAVA_1_2.java
simmilar to HW14, but each line is symmetric digit patterns

#### 3) JAVA_1_3.java
 simmilar to HW14, HW15. the digits should be connected even when the lines change. 
 odd line is left to right, even line is right to left.


#### 4) JAVA_2_1.java
Determines whether the received 9 by 9 matrix is Sudoku. If it is sudoku - valid / is not - invalid.
First variable s is 45(sum of 1 to 9). and compare with each column, row, square's sum. If it is same, it is sudoku.

#### 5) JAVA_2_2.java
Input the size of the matrix and print the sum of each column and row at the bottom and left.

#### 4) JAVA_2_3.java
 Randomly generate scores from 0 to 100, and output a histogram that goes up from the bottom, breaking into 10 units, such as 0≤x <10, 10≤x <20, ... , 90≤x≤100 .

## MATLAB ( Numerical Analysis )

### 1) interp.m
select method 'lagrange' of 'newton'. this function performs interpolation of polynomial.

### 2) falespos.m 
 fin the root by using false position method, maximum iteration : 50(default)

### 3) goldmax.m 
find the root by using goldmax method

### 4) modsecant.m 
 find the root by using modified secant method.
